 ### Two types of Components in react Js

 ***1: class component:***
 ***2: function components:***

 ### Which is better class or functional component?

 Nothing is better, because both have pros and cons. But class components are important to understand React flow and lifecycle methods.

The new learner should practice React using class components. Once they are familiar with class components, they can learn and use functional components.

Nowadays most apps use functional components due to their simplicity, ease of use, and understanding. Also, functional components have become very famous after hooks were introduced in React v16.8.
